- 👋 Hi, I’m @shubham-Mundhra
- 👀 I’m interested in solving issues that have been solved before. So I can learn to solve the ones that haven't been.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ because I consider it a good starting point.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for now. At least till I learn the basics properly
- 📫 How to reach me - thats something I would like to know to.
